## About the Project

**What is "The King of Mi Ami"** <br>
The King of Mi Ami is inspired by the legend of “The Sword in the Stone”.
Whoever extracts the sword becomes king for a day. This project is designed to be an easy way to escape from the boredom of a long wait and to engage a large number of people in a group game. This project is meant to be played in the context of a festival, in this case the Mi Ami Festival of Milan, where there is the need to entertain a large group of fans before the show begins. Everyone who possesses a smartphone and is located inside a defined area can access the game and can conquer to become the daily king by dragging the legendary sword out of the stone. The sword can be touched only every 10 seconds and in the meanwhile the user can see other gamers’ attempts.  If the sword isn’t touched in 15 seconds, it will go back inside the rock. If a user manages to pull out the sword, he/she is named King of Mi Ami for the current day and can access to the concert backstage or win a free beer. The other users will see an animation in which their defeat is declared, the name of the new king is shown with the invitation to try again the following day.

## Context
###### MI AMI FESTIVAL
[MI AMI Festival](https://www.miamifestival.it/2020/) Musica Importante A Milano is a music festival organized by Rockit.it since 2005. It takes place every year in a park, currently the Idroscalo of Milan, during the last weekend of May. It hosts Italian artists from a predominantly independent area, alternative, without distinction of musical genre but with a careful musical-cultural selection. MI AMI is the most known summer festival of Milano, and it has an indie vibe and style that aligns perfectly with the mood of our site.

<p align="center"> <img src="images-readme/miami_festival.jpg"></p>

At the beginning the project was designed to be placed at PolEATecnico Bistò (ex Bar La Rossa), creating a more local and restricted experience, but something was missing: it's a common game but the common game atmosphere was not really present. The decision was to move to a larger and more populated environment where you can have a large screen to view and play in the community, but without forgetting about the sectorialization: the game brings together people who are already interested in participating in the same experience.

###### THE BIG SCREEN
Thanks to this change of location we can take advantage of the big screen projection of the live game, that will be played in moments of stalemate from the opening of the gates, to the waiting for the singers, allowing everyone to perceive the position of the sword. It became a real group experience, in which the competition is even more present, given that it will appear both the number of the "knight" that are trying to conquer the sword (and the name of the King at the end).

(There will be also a QR code that will appear on the big screen and it will allow to play only by framing it with the phone.)

###### REAL WINNING 
We tought about a collaboration with MI AMI Festival, and thanks to it there will be a prize that is offered by the sponsor, such as a backstage meeting with the artist, or free beers for the real King of the day.

## Design Challenges

Our desire was to make an experience that killed the typical boredom in a queue at the MI AMI Festival
but also that would be inclusive for everybody, and in order to achieved that we thinked about projecting the challenge in the big screen that the Festival already has.

###### STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY
We tried to make the game increasingly less a lottery, and much more a meritocratic system of strategy, where everyone can try to understand when is the best time to try and swipe the sword and ensure victory. 
Hence three very important choices: 
1. Insert a precision bar within the game screen. This will create a threshold of difficulty, which will allow only the most precise and valiant to raise the sword.
2. Show the number of players in the big screen. 
3. Show a timer in the mobile game screen that allows the gamer to understand how long he has to wait before tapping again. 

###### ARCADE STYLE GRAPHICS
Everything aims to the facility of the gameplay, that has to be intuitive and really easy to follow, in order to make a lot of people play toghether without impediments. This includes the stylistic choice of an arcade game, very easy to follow and with graphics that allows you to play it even in a distracted way.

###### VISUAL DESIGN
We choose a Pixel Art style, that is almost entirely based on a 51 width pixels grid.
The palette tries to evoque a magic ambience, set into the woods, where the magic sword is stuck. The principal colour is green, that is then declined in shades of the same green, along with some brown shades. 

As for the info and the structure of the game, we used an off-white colour.

Smooth animations ???????

## Website experience

In order to do so we divided the experience in different steps:

###### STEP #1
Two screens of brief introduction to the realm and to the rules and instructions to follow in order to play the game

<p align="center"> <img src="images-readme" style="height:300px"></p>

###### STEP #2
Two possibilities:<br>
- if the player is not in the area of "Mi Ami Festival Reign" will appear a map indicating the distance from the area;
<br>- if the player is in the area on the contrary the game screen will appear, and you can start to play. Here two situations can happen: one where the sword has already been drawn, which will mean that you can try to play again the next day, and one where the sword is still stuck in the rock. You can play in the latter case by swipe.

<p align="center"> <img src="" style="height:300px"></p>
<p align="center"> <img src="" style="height:300px"></p>

###### STEP #3
The game begins. In between each swipe you will have to wait 30 seconds, and there will be a timer to indicate this. Also, you will be able to see the other pulling the sword (little craving, huh?). Be careful because if the sword is not touched for 20 seconds it will go down completely.

###### STEP #4 - if you win**<br> Winning animation -- sword -- .....

###### STEP #4 - if you lose**<br> Losing animation ????-- try again tomorrow

We studied and tried to focus on the legend of The Sword in the Stone, along with some researches about traditional videogame, mass competition, wasting time on a queue. Here two useful links:
